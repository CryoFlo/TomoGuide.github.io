# Sub-Tomogram Averaging

There is an overlap between the two methods in the technique called sub-tomogram averaging (STA), where repeated copies of the same structure (e.g., ribosomes, viral spikes, etc.) are extracted from tomograms and averaged to enhance resolution. 
This is what the tutorial is mainly going to cover.

Hence, cryo-ET provides a powerful way to visualize cellular architecture and macromolecular complexes within their native environment, particularly when combined with FIB milling for preparing thin lamellae of cells. 
Although it generally achieves lower resolution compared to single-particle analysis, cryo-ET’s ability to capture spatial information about molecules within intact cells makes it indispensable for exploring the structural biology of complex, heterogeneous systems.

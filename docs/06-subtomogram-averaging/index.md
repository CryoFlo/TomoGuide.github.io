# Sub-Tomogram Averaging

Overlap between cryo-ET and SPA: repeated copies of the same structure (e.g., ribosomes, viral spikes) are extracted from tomograms and averaged to enhance resolution. This tutorial focuses on STA.

Hence, cryo-ET (plus FIB milling) can visualize cellular architecture in situ, albeit usually at lower resolution than SPA. Its ability to capture spatial information in intact cells is indispensable for exploring complex systems.

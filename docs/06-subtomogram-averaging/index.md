# Sub-Tomogram Averaging

Cryo-ET can achieve higher resolution through **sub-tomogram averaging (STA)**, where repeated structures (e.g., ribosomes, viral spikes) are extracted from tomograms and aligned.

## **Steps in STA**
1. **Particle Picking** - Extract candidate regions from tomograms.
2. **Alignment & Classification** - Align similar particles and classify.
3. **Averaging** - Enhance resolution by averaging.

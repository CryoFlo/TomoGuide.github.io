# Particle Picking by Template Matching

## Create boundary masks of your tomograms

To restrict particle extraction (or detection) to your lamella only, and not the entire tomogram, you might want to use a "slab mask" or a boundary mask. This is particularly useful on difficult targets no minimize the amount of false positive picks.

In our case with ribosomes, a slab mask is actually not really necessary.
You can automatically create a boundary masks using [Slabify](https://github.com/CellArchLab/slabify-et). This works best on denoised tomograms. For detailed instruction check the Slabify [Wiki](https://github.com/CellArchLab/slabify-et/wiki)
If you know where you particle should be (e.g mitochondria, nucleus etc) you can further restrict your search by creating appropriate masks with software like [AMIRA](https://www.thermofisher.com/ch/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/software-em-3d-vis/amira-software/cell-biology.html?cid=msd_vds_ls_none_amr_123456_gl_pso_gaw_escchz&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADxi_GQP_HTwG5UvF75JpF-4AyxPP&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzYLABhD4ARIsALySuCSqID5sMy5zoaTDmyL_ScEreSQ_k5zh6D2_RKo_Dhr_trSPq0WOU7caAjPIEALw_wcB), [Napari](https://napari.org/stable/), [MITK](https://github.com/MITK/MITK) - or using automated membrane segmentations tools like [MemBrain-seg](https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg).

You can make a slab_mask folder inside the tomograms folder (e.g RELION5/Tomograms/jobXXX/tomograms/) for example.


## Use pytom-match-pick for template matching

Make sure you have [pytom-match-pick](https://github.com/SBC-Utrecht/pytom-match-pick) installed. Set up a template matching folder in root RELION working directory (e.g RELION5/project/template_matching).

You will need to have:
- A **template** at the correct pixel size. Here, we first use a SPA structure with matching pixel size, correct box size, and inverted contrast (black density on white background)
- A **template mask** with the same properties. It can also just be a sphere but it is not recommended here.

For more details check the [Documentation](https://sbc-utrecht.github.io/pytom-match-pick/). Generally, we recommend to use a template that was generated from the data. This gives (much) better results. Hence, template matching is also an iterative process. For challenging targets you want to rerun everything once you obtain a "low-res" structure from your data.

### Scaling a template using RELION or EMAN

Two examples of how to scale an `input.mrc` file from the [EMDB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/) for example using either `e2proc3d.py` from [EMAN2](https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2) or `relion_image_handler` from [RELION](https://github.com/3dem/relion/tree/ver5.0):

```
e2proc3d.py input.mrc output.mrc --scale=0.2 --process=filter.lowpass.gauss:cutoff_freq=0.1 --clip=84,84,84
```
```
relion_image_handler --i input.mrc --o output.mrc --rescale_angpix 7.64 --new_box 84 --force_header_angpix 7.64
```

- **`--scale=0.2`**: Rescale the pixel size by input/output so here by 5 for example.
- **`process=filter.lowpass.gauss:cutoff_freq`**: Lowpass filter as 1/Resolution. Here 10 Å for example.
- **`new_box`** or **`clip`**: Boxsize (in pixels)
- **`force_header_angpix`**: There might be some discrepancy between the desired and actual pixel size from the way RELION scales the image. We force the header to the desired pixel size.

With ribosomes, good results were obtained using:

angular search of 10°
Enable random-phase correction - YES
Enable per-tilt-weighting - YES
Are the tomograms CTF corrected? YES
Enable non-spherical mask? YES
high-pass 400
The cli.py will create a submission folder with a subfolder for each tomo to TM. So launch the cli.py from within the subfolder (e.g RELION5/Cytoribosome_23.10.24/Template_Matching/Gain1/Base_Aretomo_Ali/)

Example submission script generated by the pyTOM cli.py

# Sample Types

Cryo-ET requires thin samples (~100–200 nm) so electrons can pass through in a TEM. 
For whole cells, a focused ion beam (FIB) is used to mill thin lamellae while preserving native structure. 
For purified organelles (e.g., isolated mitochondria), you can often skip or reduce milling if they’re already thin enough. 
More complex samples (e.g., small multicellular organisms, biopsies) may need high-pressure freezing (HPF).

## In Situ VS Purified Samples

- **FIB-Milled Cellular Lamellae (In Situ)**  
  Preserves native environment: You see organelles and macromolecules in context.  
  Complex/heterogeneous: Harder to interpret because you capture full cellular complexity.

- **Purified Samples (e.g., Organelles, Large Viruses)**  
  Simpler prep: Often no milling if the organelle is small or already thin.  
  Less context: You lose interactions with other cellular components.

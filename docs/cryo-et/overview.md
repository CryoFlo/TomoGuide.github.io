# Some Words About Cryo-Electron Tomography

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an imaging method used to obtain three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of biological specimens in a close-to-native, vitrified state. 
Unlike single-particle analysis (SPA), which aims to determine the structure of purified complexes by averaging many identical particles, cryo-ET focuses on imaging large, complex biological samples (e.g., entire cells or organelles). 

Because cryo-ET produces much more “information-rich” data, you mostly work in 3D. 
You look through tomograms to find what you’re targeting, whereas SPA micrographs focus on repeated views of the same isolated particle.

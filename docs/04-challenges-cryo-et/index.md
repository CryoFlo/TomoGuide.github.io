# Challenges in Cryo-ET

## **Dose and Radiation Damage**
Electron radiation damages biological samples. The total electron dose must be strictly limited, leading to a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

## **Missing Wedge Artifact**
Due to incomplete tilt sampling (typically ±60°), 3D reconstructions contain anisotropic distortions, known as the **missing wedge** effect.

## **Beam-Induced Motion**
Even small movements in the sample can degrade resolution, especially at higher tilt angles.

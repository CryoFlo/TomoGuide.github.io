# Challenges in Cryo-ET Data Collection

- **Dose and Damage**: Electron radiation damages samples, so total dose must be minimized → low SNR.
- **Missing Wedge**: Limited tilt angles (±60° or ±70°) → incomplete angular coverage → anisotropic data.
- **Beam-induced Motion**: Even small movements degrade resolution, especially at high tilts.

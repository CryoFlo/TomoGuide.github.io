# Some words about Cryo-Electron Tomography

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an imaging method used to obtain three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of biological specimens in a close-to-native, vitrified state. Unlike single-particle analysis (SPA), which aims to determine the structure of repeated, purified macromolecular complexes by averaging thousands or even millions of identical particles, cryo-ET focuses on imaging large and complex biological samples. These can be entire cells, subcellular organelles, or thick cellular sections (lamellae) produced by focused ion beam (FIB) milling.

The main difference between SPA and cryo-ET is that cryo-ET data is far more information-rich. You might see much more than just your “target,” or sometimes it’s difficult to find it! Additionally, you mostly work in 3D (even though raw data are 2D projections). You want to look at your tomograms to understand what’s in them—unlike SPA micrographs, where you see the same particle thousands of times.

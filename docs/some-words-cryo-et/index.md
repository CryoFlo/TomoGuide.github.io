# Some Words about Cryo-Electron Tomography

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an imaging method used to obtain three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of biological specimens in a vitrified state.

Unlike single-particle analysis (SPA), which determines structures by averaging many identical particles, Cryo-ET images large biological samples, including entire cells, subcellular organelles, or thick cellular sections (lamellae) produced by focused ion beam (FIB) milling.

Cryo-ET provides an **information-rich** dataset. You will see much more than just your target macromolecules, making interpretation complex but rewarding.

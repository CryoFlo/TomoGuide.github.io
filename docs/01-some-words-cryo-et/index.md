# Some Words about Cryo-Electron Tomography

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an imaging method used to obtain three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of biological specimens in a close-to-native, vitrified state. Unlike single-particle analysis (SPA), which aims to determine the structure of repeated, purified macromolecular complexes by averaging thousands or even millions of identical particles, cryo-ET focuses on imaging large and complex biological samples. These samples can be entire cells, subcellular organelles, or thick cellular sections (lamellae) produced by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The main difference between SPA and cryo-ET, is that the data produced by cryo-ET is much more information-rich. You will see much more than what you are targeting, or sometimes it will be difficult to find what you are targeting. Additionally, you mostly work in 3D (even if the raw data are 2D projections of your sample). This means that you want to look at your tomograms to understand what’s in them (all of them!) contrary to look at SPA micrographs where you have the same things thousands of time.

(image idea for illustration: a guy with stars in the eyes looking at a tomogram vs a bored guy looking at SPA micrographs)

# Cryo-ET Data Collection Workflow

1. **Sample Preparation**  
   - FIB-milled plunge-frozen cells, HPF samples, or purified complexes.

2. **Sample Mounting**  
   - Transfer to the cryo-TEM at around -180°C.

3. **Tilt Series Acquisition**  
   - Tilt ±60°/±70° in increments (2–3°), capturing 2D projections.

4. **Alignment**  
   - Correct for stage shifts, beam-induced motion, and other distortions.

5. **Tomogram Reconstruction**  
   - 3D volume from aligned projections (back-projection or SIRT).

6. **Post-processing**  
   - Segmentation or sub-tomogram averaging, depending on goals.

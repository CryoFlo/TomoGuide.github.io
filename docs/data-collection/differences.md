# Differences Between Cryo-ET and Single-Particle Analysis (SPA)

| Feature               | Cryo-ET                                                                                          | SPA                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sample Type**       | Unique cellular or subcellular specimens (FIB-milled lamellae, intact viruses/cells)             | Purified, isolated macromolecules or particles                                          |
| **3D Reconstruction** | 3D volume from multiple tilt images of the same specimen                                         | 3D from averaging many 2D projections of multiple copies                                |
| **Resolution**        | Often lower (5–10 nm for cells, sub-nm if sub-tomogram averaging)                                | Near-atomic (2–4 Å) for well-behaved particles                                         |
| **Context**           | In situ, preserving spatial relationships within the cell                                        | In vitro, losing native environment                                                    |
| **Data Requirement**  | Single tilt series per region of interest; each structure might be unique                        | Thousands to millions of particle images for high resolution                            |
| **Throughput**        | Lower, time-consuming data collection                                                            | Higher, with automated pipelines                                                       |

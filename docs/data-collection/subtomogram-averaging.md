# Sub-Tomogram Averaging

STA is where Cryo-ET and SPA overlap: repeated copies of the same structure (ribosomes, spikes, etc.) are extracted from tomograms and averaged to improve resolution.

Hence, cryo-ET is powerful for visualizing cellular architecture in situ, especially with FIB milling, albeit at typically lower resolution than SPA. Combining tomograms with STA yields higher-resolution insights while preserving native context.

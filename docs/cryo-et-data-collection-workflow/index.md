# Cryo-ET Data Collection Workflow

1. **Sample preparation**: FIB-milled plunge-frozen cells or HPFed sample, or a purified specimen of interest.  
2. **Sample Mounting**: Transferred into the cryo-TEM (below -180°C).  
3. **Tilt Series Acquisition**: Tilt stage ±60° (or ±40°) in 2–3° increments, recording 2D projections.  
4. **Alignment**: Correct for stage shifts, beam-induced motion, etc.  
5. **Tomogram Reconstruction**: 3D volume from aligned projections (weighted back-projection or SIRT).  
6. **Post-processing**: Segmentation or sub-tomogram averaging if repeated complexes exist.

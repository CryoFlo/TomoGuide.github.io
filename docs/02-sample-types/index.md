#Sample Types

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) requires thin samples (around 100–200 nm) so the electron beam can pass through (we are using transmission electron microscopes (**TEM**)). For whole cells, a focused ion beam (FIB) is used to mill thin lamellae while preserving native structure. However, if you’re studying purified organelles (e.g., isolated mitochondria), you can sometimes skip or reduce milling if they’re already thin enough. People are also now going towards more complex samples (e.g small multicellular organisms, or biopsies) which involve high-pressure freezing (**HPF**) of the sample instead of the more classical plunge-freezing.

A critical philosophical difference is that cryo-ET aims to observe macromolecules in their natural cellular context. Meanwhile, SPA requires extensive purification steps, removing the protein complexes from their native milieu but achieving higher resolution in exchange for losing cellular context.

### FIB-Milled Cellular Lamellae
- **Preserves In Situ Context:** You see organelles and macromolecules in their native environment (cell membranes, cytoskeleton, neighboring structures).
- **Complex and Heterogeneous:** More challenging to prepare and interpret because you capture the full cellular complexity.

### Purified sample (e.g organelles, large viruses, etc)
- **Simpler Prep:** Often no milling needed if the organelle is inherently small or can be fractionated to the right thickness.
- **Less Context:** You lose interactions with other cellular components—what you gain in simplicity, you lose in native spatial relationships.

In short, cellular lamellae capture the true cellular environment at the expense of more complex data collection and processing, whereas purified organelles simplify tomography but lose the broader context.

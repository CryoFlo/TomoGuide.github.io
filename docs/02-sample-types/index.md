# Sample types

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) requires thin samples (around 100–200 nm) so the electron beam can pass through (we use a TEM). For whole cells, a focused ion beam (FIB) is used to mill thin lamellae while preserving native structure. However, if you’re studying purified organelles (e.g., isolated mitochondria), you can sometimes skip or reduce milling if they’re already thin enough. Researchers also use more complex samples (e.g., small multicellular organisms, biopsies) with high-pressure freezing (HPF) instead of classic plunge-freezing.

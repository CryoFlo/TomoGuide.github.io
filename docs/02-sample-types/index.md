Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) requires thin samples (around 100–200 nm) so the electron beam can pass through (we are using transmission electron microscopes (**TEM**)). For whole cells, a focused ion beam (FIB) is used to mill thin lamellae while preserving native structure. However, if you’re studying purified organelles (e.g., isolated mitochondria), you can sometimes skip or reduce milling if they’re already thin enough. People are also now going towards more complex samples (e.g small multicellular organisms, or biopsies) which involve high-pressure freezing (**HPF**) of the sample instead of the more classical plunge-freezing.

# Cryo-ET Data Collection Workflow

1. **Sample preparation**  
   FIB-milled plunge-frozen cells, HPFed samples, or purified macromolecules of interest.

2. **Sample Mounting**  
   The sample is transferred into the cryo-TEM (kept below –180°C).

3. **Tilt Series Acquisition**  
   The stage is tilted incrementally (e.g., usually ±60° or ±40°) with 2–3° increments, collecting 2D projections at each tilt angle.

4. **Alignment**  
   Projections are aligned to correct for stage shifts, beam-induced motion, etc.

5. **Tomogram Reconstruction**  
   A 3D volume is reconstructed from aligned tilt series using weighted back-projection or SIRT.

6. **Post-processing & Further Analyses**  
   You can segment specific structures in the tomogram or perform sub-tomogram averaging if you have repeated complexes.

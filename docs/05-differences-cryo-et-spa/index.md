# Differences Between Cryo-ET and Single-Particle Analysis (SPA)

| Aspect                | Cryo-ET                                                                                                     | SPA                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sample Type**       | Unique cellular or subcellular specimens (FIB-milled lamellae or intact viruses/cells)                      | Purified, isolated macromolecular complexes or particles                                       |
| **3D Reconstruction** | 3D volume from multiple tilt images of the same specimen                                                    | 3D reconstruction from averaging many 2D projections of multiple identical particles           |
| **Resolution**        | Typically lower (5–10 nm for cellular tomography, can reach sub-nm w/ sub-tomogram averaging)               | Can reach near-atomic (2–4 Å) for well-behaved particles and large data sets                   |
| **Context**           | In situ: preserves spatial relationships within the cell                                                    | In vitro: studied in isolation, removed from native environment                                |
| **Data Requirement**  | Single tilt series per region of interest                                                                    | Thousands to millions of particle images needed for high-resolution averaging                  |
| **Throughput**        | Lower, time-consuming data collection                                                                       | Higher, with automated data collection and pipelines                                          |

# Differences Between Cryo-ET and Single-Particle Analysis (SPA)

| Aspect                 | Cryo-ET                                                                                   | Single-Particle Analysis (SPA)                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sample Type**        | Unique cellular or subcellular specimens (e.g., FIB-milled lamellae or intact viruses/cells) | Purified, isolated macromolecular complexes or particles             |
| **3D Reconstruction**  | 3D volume from multiple tilt images of the *same* specimen                                | 3D reconstruction from averaging many 2D projections of *multiple copies* of a particle in different orientations |
| **Resolution**         | Typically lower (5–10 nm for cellular tomography, though can reach sub-nm with sub-tomogram averaging) | Can reach near-atomic resolutions (2–4 Å) for well-behaved particles and large data sets |
| **Structural Context** | *In situ*: preserves spatial relationships within the cell                                | *In vitro*: particles are studied in isolation, removed from their native environment |
| **Data Requirement**   | Single tilt series per region of interest, capturing unique structures                    | Thousands to millions of particle images needed for high-resolution averaging |
| **Throughput**         | Lower – time-consuming data collection per specimen                                      | Potentially higher – automated data collection and well-optimized pipelines |

# Differences Between Cryo-ET and Single-Particle Analysis (SPA)

| Feature         | Cryo-ET | SPA |
|----------------|--------|-----|
| Sample Type    | Unique cellular specimens | Purified macromolecules |
| 3D Reconstruction | Tilt-series of same sample | 3D averaging of particles |
| Resolution     | Lower (5-10 nm) | Higher (2-4 Å) |
| Structural Context | **Preserved** (in situ) | **Lost** (isolated particles) |
